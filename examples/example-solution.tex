The exercises below are taken from \cite[Chapter IV]{har77}.

\begin{xca}{1.1}
  Let $X$ be a curve, and let $P \in X$ be a point.
  Then there exists a nonconstant rational functino $f \in K(X)$, which is regular everywhere except at $P$.
  
  \begin{solution}
    We need to show that $l(nP) > 1$ for some non-zero $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
    Indeed, Riemann--Roch implies that this holds for all large enough $n \in \mathbb{N}$, as explained in \cite[Remark 1.3.2]{har77}.
  \end{solution}
